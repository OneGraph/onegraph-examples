# [PackageInfo](https://packageinfo.now.sh)

PackageInfo is a service that provides detailed information about [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com) using [OneGraph](https://www.onegraph.com). It combines information from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), [Github](http://github.com) and [BundlePhobia](https://bundlephobia.com).

## Stack
PackageInfo is built with a set of modern web technologies.

* [OneGraph](https://www.onegraph.com): A service that seamlessly connects many services in a single GraphQL API. It provides all the package information from npm and Github in a single request!
* [react-onegraph](https://github.com/rofrischmann/react-onegraph): React Bindings for OneGraph's [Authentication Client](https://www.onegraph.com/docs/logging_users_in_and_out.html).
* [React](http://reactjs.org): A library for component-based user interfaces.
* [Next](http://nextjs.org): A framework for React-powered web applications.
* [Now](https://zeit.co): A platform for serverless application deployment used to serve PackageInfo.
* [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/): A GrapQL client that connects OneGraph with PackageInfo.
* [Fela](http://fela.js.org): A CSS in JS styling library that renders to Atomic CSS.
* [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis): A visualization library for React used to render the download graphs.
* [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown): A library that renders Markdown to React components used to render the Readme. 
* [react-markdown-github-renderers](https://github.com/robinweser/react-markdown-github-renderers): A set of react-markdown renderers providing GitHub-like appearance

## Sharing links
Searching for packages will automatically update the URL to include the package name in order to share it e.g.
```url
https://packageinfo.now.sh/?package=graphql
```

## Running locally
Before running locally, we have to add a `env.js` file that exports our OneGraph API_ID. In order to get one, simply log in to your *OneGraph Dashboard* and choose an existing app or create a new one and copy its App Id in the *Settings* panel. 

##### env.js
```javascript
export const APP_ID = /* ID */
```

Now we can run the app using the following commands:
```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```
To run in production (for deployments), we have to run:
```sh
yarn build
yarn start
```

## How it works

Whenever the search input changes, the UI updates its state and the Apollo client triggers a new request to OneGraph that receives all the relevant data for a package. Here's what the query looks like:

```graphql
query npm($package: String!, $startDate: String!, $endDate: String!) {
  npm {
    package(name: $package) {
      homepage
      keywords
      description
      keywords
      name
      readme
      readmeFilename
      license {
        type
      }
      maintainers {
        name
      }
      versions {
        version
        dependencies {
          name
          version
        }
      }
      downloads {
        period(startDate: $startDate, endDate: $endDate) {
          perDay {
            day
            count
          }
        }
      }
      time {
        versions {
          date
          version
        }
      }
      bundlephobia {
        gzip
        size
        history {
          gzip
          size
          version
        }
        dependencySizes {
          approximateSize
          name
        }
      }
      repository {
        url
        sourceRepository {
          ... on GitHubRepository {
            name
            url
            homepageUrl
            defaultBranchRef {
              name
            }
            stargazers {
              totalCount
            }
            watchers {
              totalCount
            }
            issues(states: OPEN) {
              totalCount
            }
            forks {
              totalCount
            }
            pullRequests(states: OPEN) {
              totalCount
            }
            primaryLanguage {
              name
              color
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
OneGraph itself triggers 6 requests to npm's and Github's API in order to collect the data.<br>
It also handles the Github authorization that is required to access data from Github. All the client has to do is calling the login function that is provided by [onegraph-auth](https://www.onegraph.com/docs/logging_users_in_and_out.html#log-the-user-in).
